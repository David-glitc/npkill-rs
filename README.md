# npkill-rs

**Fast interactive tool to find and delete `node_modules` and `.next` directories — written in Rust.**

A Rust reimplementation of [npkill](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill) with added support for `.next` directories, mouse interactions, real-time search, sorting, and a polished TUI.

## Features

- **Dual target scanning** — finds both `node_modules` and `.next` directories
- **Interactive TUI** — keyboard + mouse navigation, scroll support
- **Real-time search** — press `/` to filter results by path
- **Multi-sort** — sort by Size, Date, or Path (press `s` to cycle, `S` to reverse)
- **Live animations** — spinner, progress bar, deletion effects
- **ETA display** — estimated time remaining during scans
- **Blacklist / Whitelist** — skip specific directories or force-include them
- **Risk analysis** — detects sensitive locations (`.config`, `AppData`, etc.)
- **Dry-run mode** — preview deletions without touching files
- **Batch delete** — `--delete-all` with optional `-y` confirmation
- **JSON output** — machine-readable output (use `--json`)
